## Git vs. GitHub

Git and Github are similar, but _very_ different.

Git: takes snapshots of code and save it; can be reverted back to it at any point and saved. It doesn't require GitHub to use.

Github: it stores commits from git to the cloud also know as their website, [github.com](https://www.github.com). Also GitHub needs Git.
